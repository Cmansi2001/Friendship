Side by side, through thick and thin,
Best friends' journey, let it begin.
Laughter shared and secrets kept,
A bond unbreakable, forever adept

In the honour of friendship
In the realm of hearts entwined,
Where bonds of friendship brightly shine,
A tapestry of souls we weave,
With threads of trust that never leave.

Through laughter's joy and tearful days,
Friendship's light forever stays,
A guiding star through stormy skies,
A constant presence, never denies.

In times of need, a hand to hold,
A warming touch, so pure and bold,

Through trials, thick and challenges vast,  hiiieeeeeee mansi
Friendship's fire will forever last.  changes are done by pratikkkkkk

Through trials, thick and challenges , Hiiii mansi
Friendship's fire will forever last.  changes are done here......


With shared secrets and whispered dreams,
In unity, we mend the seams,
Through highs and lows, we find our way,
In friendship's embrace, come what may.

I Love you Manu............<3<3<3

So here's to friends, both old and new,
A cherished bond, forever true,
In this symphony of hearts so kind,
Friendship's melody forever binds.
