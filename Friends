In the realm of hearts entwined,
Where bonds of friendship brightly shine,
A tapestry of souls we weave,
With threads of trust that never leave.

Through laughter's joy and tearful days,
Friendship's light forever stays,
A guiding star through stormy skies,
A constant presence, never denies.

In times of need, a hand to hold,
A warming touch, so pure and bold,
Through trials, thick and challenges vast,
Friendship's fire will forever last.

With shared secrets and whispered dreams,
In unity, we mend the seams,
Through highs and lows, we find our way,
In friendship's embrace, come what may.

So here's to friends, both old and new,
A cherished bond, forever true,
In this symphony of hearts so kind,
Friendship's melody forever binds.
